      <p class="item-name">Ghoomar</p>
      <p>Ghoomar is a dance traditionally developed by the Bhil tribe of Rajasthan. Later adopted by other communities of Rajasthan it assumed the status of ‘folk dance of the state’. Essentially performed by women, with no bar on age, the dance was initially meant only for ladies’ gatherings where the swirling females in colorful robes would dance to catchy rhythmic tunes sung by both men and women. The dance is so graceful and lovely to watch, where claps of the hands, clicking of finges and other small movements are done with extraordinary unison, that it has become a major tourist attraction as well. Enthusiastic members of the audience sometimes jump up to catchy numbers to perform the steps on the sidelines in tune with the dance being performed. As the song progresses the music gets fastern and the tempo of the dancers, increases in synch..<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
